# Pix2Pix - Image-to-Image Translation using cGAN

This project implements a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) using the Pix2Pix framework for performing image-to-image translation tasks, such as converting sketches to real photos, maps to satellite views, or edges to images.

## 📌 Features
- Conditional GAN (cGAN) based on Pix2Pix architecture
- TensorFlow 2.x implementation
- Uses Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset (can be replaced with others)
- Trains on paired images and generates realistic outputs
- Includes Google Colab support for easy running
